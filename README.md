# EdgeLight Chrome Extension

Simulate a professional studio ring light using your own computer screen. This extension creates a customizable bright border around any website **automatically when your camera activates**.

## Features
- **Auto-Activation**: The ring light automatically turns on when your camera is in use (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom) and fades out when you stop.
- **Mac-Style Design**: Sleek, glassmorphism UI that fits right into modern workflows.
- **Color Temperature**: Adjust from Cool Blue to Warm Orange.
- **Customizable**: Control Brightness and Ring Width.
- **Privacy-First**: No video processing. We only detect *if* the camera is on to help you look your best.

## How to Use
1.  **Install & Pin**: Load the extension and pin it to your toolbar.
2.  **Toggle ON**: Ensure the extension is enabled (Main toggle in popup).
3.  **Start a Call**: Go to Google Meet or use the **Test Page**.
4.  **Auto-Light**: As soon as the camera connects, the screen border will glow.
5.  **Adjust**: Open the popup to tweak the color or thickness.

## Installation
1.  Open Chrome `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer Mode**.
3.  Click **Load Unpacked** and select the extension folder.
