# EdgeLight Chrome Extension

Simulate a professional studio ring light using your own computer screen. This extension creates a customizable bright border around any website, using the monitor's light to illuminate your face for webcam calls.

## Features
- **Screen Ring Light**: Adds a bright border overlay to the current tab.
- **Color Temperature**: Adjust from Cool Blue (2000K) to Warm Orange (10000K) to match your environment.
- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the opacity of the light.
- **Adjustable Thickness**: make the light border thick or thin.
- **Privacy-First**: No camera access required. No data collection.

## How to Use
1.  **Click the EdgeLight icon** in your toolbar.
2.  **Toggle ON**.
3.  Adjust **Thickness**, **Brightness**, and **Color**.
4.  The border will persist on the page. You can click through the empty center of the screen to interact with the page.

## Installation
1.  Open Chrome `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer Mode**.
3.  Click **Load Unpacked** and select the extension folder.

## Troubleshooting
- **Light not appearing?** Refresh the page. The content script needs to inject the overlay.
- **Can't click?** The center of the screen is click-through. If the border is very thick, it might cover edge buttons.
